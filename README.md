# BMI Calculator Assignment

## Author: Braden Garrison

## Due: 9/14/21

## Program Instructions:

To run the BMI Calculator from the command line, type:

```python bmi_calc.py```

The program will first print a welcome message and a few instructions with examples of proper data input.  
Follow these examples to input your weight first with the numerical value followed by a space and either "pounds" or "kilograms".
Then, input your height with the numerical value followed by a space and either "inches" or "meters".

The program should then calculate your BMI and associated BMI range and output in the format as follows:

```Your calculated BMI is ___ which places you in the ________ range.```

In the event that you mistype your units or mix metric units with standard units, the program will output this error message:

```Sorry, the units have been entered incorrectly. Please try again.```

If this happens, simply return to the top of these instructions and re-run the BMI Calculator from the command line.
